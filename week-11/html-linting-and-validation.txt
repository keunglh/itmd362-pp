# Production Problem 6: HTML De-Linting and Validation

## The Problem

Using the HTML Tidy tool, installed as a command-line tool on your
computer via instructions at http://www.html-tidy.org, and the HTML
validator at http://validator.w3.org, rework the HTML file in this directory
(`index.html`) so that is free from errors.

## Resources

* HTML Tidy: http://www.html-tidy.org/
* HTML Validator: http://validator.w3.org/

## Deliverables

1. First, run HTML Tidy on the index.html file. Copy and paste the errors here:
line 6 column 5 - Warning: <meta> unexpected or duplicate quote mark
line 9 column 5 - Error: <figure> is not recognized!
line 9 column 5 - Warning: discarding unexpected <figure>
line 10 column 46 - Warning: <img> attribute with missing trailing quote mark
line 13 column 14 - Warning: replacing invalid character code 128
line 13 column 15 - Warning: replacing invalid character code 153
line 14 column 5 - Warning: discarding unexpected </figure>
line 10 column 7 - Warning: missing </a> before <p>
line 5 column 5 - Warning: <meta> proprietary attribute "charset"
line 5 column 5 - Warning: <meta> lacks "content" attribute
line 7 column 5 - Warning: <link> inserting "type" attribute
line 16 column 5 - Warning: <script> inserting "type" attribute
Info: Document content looks like HTML Proprietary
11 warnings, 1 error were found!

2. Fix as many errors as are listed by HTML Tidy, and re-run until
there are no errors reported. HINT: Always fix the first error reported,
then re-run tidy. Then, run the contents of `index.html` through the HTML
 validator. List any errors that the validator reports here:

3. Finally, fix the errors that are listed by the HTML validator, and
 commit the `index.html` file in its error-free state.


4. Bonus: What error remained that neither Tidy nor the validator did
not catch? Fix it, if you've not already, and mark as its own commit.
