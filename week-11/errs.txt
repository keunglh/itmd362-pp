This document has errors that must be fixed before
using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.

Character codes 128 to 159 (U+0080 to U+009F) are not allowed in HTML;
even if they were, they would likely be unprintable control characters.
Tidy assumed you wanted to refer to a character with the same byte value in the 
specified encoding and replaced that reference with the Unicode equivalent.
