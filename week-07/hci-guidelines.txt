# Production Problem 5: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, Android, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment.

You only need to sketch your redesign, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/

* Android Design Guidelines:
  http://developer.android.com/design/index.html

* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://dev.windows.com/en-us/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guideline One (URL): https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Branding.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH60-SW1
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
One problem that has always bugged me as well as many are the shameless plugs and mentions of IIT within that portal page.
However such branding is pointless as this login portal is typically used by the students that have already been admitted or
current students of IIT. As a result, I decided to revamp the branding aspect of the site to give it a "unique look and feel" to
give the users an experience that isn't an eyesore with harsh typography and most of all, a warm and inviting color with broad
and curved text. Although my sketch may not illustrate it too well, I wanted to keep a color palette of gray, red, black, and
orange similar to IIT's main page. However, instead of a sharp bright red, I wanted to focus on more of a washed/dull red that
still can stick out but doesn't cause someone to shirk back in shock. Another element I wanted to add is a background image to
the page that can help with branding. Meant to stay in the background behind the content container, it would be an image overlooking
the Chicago skyline as well as the IIT campus. An image that still awes me today, I think it would be a great thing to show
others about the good and beauty that IIT can offer. Though "IIT" pops up a few times on the page, they're only used as
necessary and for concise instructions meant to avoid ambiguity.

* HCI Guideline Two (URL): https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Iconography.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH59-SW1
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
As I mentioned earlier, I wanted to add a background graphic to accompany the main portal page. However the main point of interest
are the icons that are placed throughout the page. One of them is the MyIIT logo that I hope to keep in the header. Other than
that, most of the page is text, image and negative space. However, when we get to the navigation menu, there will be essentially
two formats. For the mobile devices, the menu would pop out and blur the background and provide the necessary buttons.
On a desktop version, the menu would essentially pop out from the side and shift the page into a smaller dimension. The icons
are mainly placed along the menu options to help provide a graphic. Using a single small icon, it was a bit difficult to try and
encompass the necessary links but I chose what I thought were the most appropriate.


* HCI Guideline Three (URL): https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/Navigation.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH53-SW1
* How you implemented it in your sketch:
In the first sketch, I wanted to address the idea and implementation of navigation that provides a well though out
and strong decision making proccess. Both in the mobile and desktop version, there would be an icon on the top left of the
screen as well as a caption that says, "Not Where You Want To Be?". In it is the main navigation bar for the page, since this
is mainly a login page for the student portal, the menu bar would help redirect lost students or prospective students at other
resources about IIT. The way I planned the navigation would be hierarchical as well as experience/content driven because I picked
some of the most commonly asked topics and departments as well as provided a hierarchical scheme for further information as
seen on the sketch. However, I tried to keep the "choices" short and concise so that users would not get frustrated
and just end up exiting. Of course, the navigation bar won't be all encompassing, so that users will have to travel farther
themselves to access information that they couldn't find but most of the key links will be provided.

Ran into a problem with my linux machine, making sure these commits will still work and all.
