# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) Screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) An explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Explanation of your color choices: Having built a custom-made gaming desktop, I spent a lot of time planning and viewing several
samples of color schemes. In the end, I chose a strong blue and black combination but in this palette, I decided to focus on the
blue with some darker underlying tone while trying to emphasize a more bright and blue overall tone. Similar to a blue flame,
it is supposed to represent strength and power, but in a computer sense, speed and power is king.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.
