# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) Screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;
2) An explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Filename: monochromatic.png
Explanation of your color choices: Having built a custom-made gaming desktop, I spent a lot of time planning and viewing several
samples of color schemes. In the end, I chose a strong blue and black combination but in this palette, I decided to focus on the
blue with some darker underlying tone while trying to emphasize a more bright and blue overall tone. Similar to a blue flame,
it is supposed to represent strength and power, but in a computer sense, speed and power is king.

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Filename: shaded.png
Explanation of your color choices: Since the website will most likely have images of more green vegetables, fruits and produce,
I wanted to overall have a more earthy-tone and natural color scheme reminiscent of dirt, with some slight darker red/brown shades
to try and simulate more of a clay texture and feel. With that in mind, I could have went with a more green tone to represent the
organic and natural foods but with the content assuming images of what would already be there, I felt a brown-earth tone would be
a better fit.

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Filename: complementary.png
Explanation of your color choices: I guess taking some inspiration from some banking institutions that I know, I tried to analyze
and think about their colors and tried to incorporate my own interpretation. I chose the multiple shades of blue to represent
an inherent serenity and peace when banking, without the worries of loss, fraud or any other risks that are typically attributed.
However, I also wanted to add a color of gray to try and represent the stolid security of a bank by representing the color of
mortar, stone, bricks etc. And lastly, the yellow is not only a representation of "gold" and money, but also for the sunrise and
sunsets to represent a new day and end of not only safe and reliable banking but one that helps the customer in their financial
endeavors.

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Filename: triadic.png
Explanation of your color choices: Similar to the banking website, I did some personal experience and research on the kinds of games
that I played when I was a child. Although I primarily played many flash games, I don't expect this generation of children to be
doing the same so I focused more on browser based games such as Runescape, Neopets, Club Penguins and other children's games that
are common mentioned. As a result, I tried to incorporate strong colors such as Blue and Red to catch attention, and then colors
representative of gold and silver to highlight the adventures and progression for children. In addition, I tried to keep more "dull"
colors instead of the typical hard/strong blue. Although blue and red are still relatively strong and "cutting" colors, I tried to
dampen the scheme a bit more, especially with the prevalence of technology for the future generations, it's important to protect
the eyes.
