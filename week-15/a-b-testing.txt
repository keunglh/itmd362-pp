# Production Problem 9: A/B Testing on the Cheap

## The Problem

Locate an interface component on some website that you use frequently that you think could be improved. The improvement should be minor, as we discussed in class.

Take a screenshot of the interface on both a mobile and desktop device. Then, sketch or illustrate your alternate/"b" test. Finally,
describe modification and the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write in order to conduct the test.

## Deliverables

* Screenshots of the interface component on mobile and desktop, placed in this directory (`week-15`)

* Sketch or illustrate (e.g., in Photoshop) your alternate/"b" test, placed in this directory (`week-15`)

* A text description of the modification, and a description of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that you would need to write for
 the test (you do *not* have to write the actual HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, however)

For the most part, the desktop version of the website was pretty good and I had little to no qualms about it.
However, the most annoying part for me was how the "Trendings" bar was so obscure and even today, still escapes my eye many times.
As a result, the modification that I made was simple, just to make it a more explicit background color from the light gray to the
dark gray that was used for the header bar at the top of the site. I didn't want to make it the main navigation bar red header because
I didn't want to cause any confusion with the user that the trendings might also be a comprehensive navigation bar as well.

Although the gray may clash slightly with the color used to display the main/featured articles, that's fine because they're both doing
similar tasks by featuring specific articles or topics that have received a lot of traction or attention.

Inspecting the HTML for the trending bar, each of the links are statically linked topics. However if I was able to change it, I would
try and have it dynamically updated depending on the "tags" linked to the most read articles per week. Although it may not make much of a
difference because those trending topics are "buzzwords" in the industry but to have a dynamically updated "trending" bar would make it
that much more trendier. Of course, there will also need to have the corresponding javascript.

The CSS would essentially change the height of the trending bar as well as the background and font color in order to create a
good contrast.

p.s I would also completely redo the mobile site because it is very poorly designed to be mobile-first responsive.
