# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life
 (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a
 photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral,
  and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three
  qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your
  MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: How the design concerts itself with appearances. Appearances.
The water bottle is appealing to my eyes and soothing, blue is one of my favorite
colors, especially dark blue. I've always been a fan of the blue/black contrasting
color palette so when I first received the water bottle it allowed me to have this
low-level visceral feeling. It has the image of being a stury and stubborn object,
able to take a beating. Although it may not be clear in the images, but there have been
scuffs and dents along the side as well as the cap that indicates my heavy use.

* Behavioral: Pleasure and effectiveness of use.
Although it is pleasurable and appealing to my eyes, I actually don't have much
pleasure in using it because it is not the most efficient and functional
water bottle for me. First off, the cap isn't attached to the bottle in any way
so I always have this fear when I take it from my room that I will lose the cap
by accidentally placing it somewhere when I want a drink of something and forget
to put it back. In addition, it has a little "bump/click" to indicate that it has
been sealed shut, but using it for almost 4 years now has worn down the bump so
it's always a hit or miss using it. Lastly, the opening is relatively narrow and
small which makes the cleaning process very difficult, as a result, I'm mainly
confined to drinking water because I'm not able to stick a sponge inside to
clean anything sweet out.

* Reflective: Rationalization and intellectualization of a product.


C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might
be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. Usability, must be intuitive as well as responsive for all sorts of media and devices.

2. Aesthetics, must capture the user, entice them. Good content, meaningful media,
and well placed design with a good flow.

3. Practicality, it has to make sense. The navigation must be intuitive, it must provide
resources to places that come across the users' thoughts. It must look good and display
thoughtful and appealing design, but not at the cost of functionality. In most cases,
I want to say that the "maximum functionality, bare necessities" can be an applicable
statement. Design must be good and everything has to have a purpose, so it's just the
bare necessities to provide the best and most comprehensive user experience.
